# UN_Datathon2023

Following the success of the past three hackathons, the United Nations Committee of Experts on Big Data and Data Science for Official Statistics (UNCEBD), Major Group for Children and Youth (MGCY), Uruguay's National Institute of Statistics, and the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data are hosting the "2023 UN Datathon". This is an exciting opportunity for students and data professionals to contribute solutions to the challenges of the Sustainable Development Goals.

The Datathon is organized from 3-6 November in conjunction with the Festival de Datos in Uruguay (7 to 9 November 2023). Participants may have the opportunity to have their work shown or presented at the Festival de Datos and winners' projects have a chance to be taken forward by the UN and its partners.

Join us on this journey of innovation, exploration, and problem-solving as we harness the power of data to create a more sustainable and resilient world.

Datathon participants will develop innovative data-driven applications, tools or statistical models combining geospatial data with other data sources to help advance the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.
