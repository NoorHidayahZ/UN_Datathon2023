"The Johor River bears the illustrious name that holds the history of the glory of the Johor Kingdom. For 400 years, the river's waters have witnessed the processes of upholding the nation's sovereignty, carrying forward the legacy of the kingdom, and reinforcing the Malay civilization's heritage in upholding the dignity of the nation, religion, and state. The history of the downfall of the Melaka kingdom in 1511 was inherited by the Johor kingdom from 1528 onwards. All the glorious moments and historical events are firmly imprinted along this river until today.

Stretching approximately 80 kilometers from the river mouth in Telok Sengat to the river's source at Sayong Pinang, the Johor River contains numerous historical remnants aged between 100 to 400 years, spanning from the reign of Sultan Alauddin Riayat Syah II (1528-1564) to Sultan Abdul Jalil Syah IV (1699-1718).

Among these remnants are the remains of old fortresses and defensive fortifications, the tombs of sultans, royalty, and royal officials, as well as other submerged structures. Some of the well-preserved remnants include Kota Batu Johor Lama, Sultan Mahmud's Tomb (Mangkat Dijulang), Bendahara Tun Habib, Kota Makam Touhid, Makam Laksamana Bentan, Sultan Muzaffar Syah, Sultan Abdul Jalil Syah I, Sultan Ali Jalla Abd. Jalil Syah, Makam 7, and Makam 12 in Sayong Pinang.

Historical sites like the old town of Pekan, Sayong Pinang, Johor Lama, Seluyut, Batu Sawar, Kota Tinggi, and Panchor, located along the banks of the Johor River, intermittently served as the capital of the Johor kingdom. Each of these locations boasts impressive defense fortifications built to withstand attacks from enemies such as the Portuguese, Dutch, Acehnese, and Jambi during that era.

The process of conserving and preserving these historical sites is carried out periodically by the government under the management of the Malaysian Museum Department and the Johor Heritage Foundation (YWJ). Records pertaining to the remnants and historical events that took place along the Johor River are all immortalized in the Kota Tinggi Museum on Laksamana Street and the Kota Johor Lama Museum in Kampung Johor Lama."
